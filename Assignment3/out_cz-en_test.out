European Innovation Partnership (EIP) in the field of active and healthy ageing is to increase by 2020 the average length of healthy life in the EU by two years.
partners aim to improve the quality of life of older citizens and more effective health care solutions.
innovation will focus on the use of innovation in a larger scale than now, in such areas such as promoting health, prevention, early diagnosis and treatment, integrated health and social care systems based on cooperation, as well as assistant technologies.
consultation analysis shall be carried out by the Commission to take a clear view to the potential and capacity of innovation in various areas that have an impact on ageing in today.
further action in the European Innovation Partnership Partnership is then planned under these responses.
online consultation is also held with the European Partnership Conference on active and healthy ageing, held in Brussels today in Brussels.
more than 150 representatives of interested parties discuss their views on it, how to transform partnerships to specific acts.

initiatives aimed at regional maintenance cooperation should be strengthened in Asia, as regards Asia, should be reinforced to initiatives aimed at regional maintenance cooperation.
EU action action approach to food security in developing countries must be based on the principles of the Paris Declaration on the effectiveness of assistance, the Action Programme of Akkkl and the EU Code of EU rules on the Labour Work on Development Policy.
EU and Member States should identify, according to their comparative advantages, regions and countries in relation to which they should split the work and coordinate their activities under the guidance of a specific principal donor.
EU and Member States have several policy frameworks and financial instruments to help partner countries deal with food security problems with problems.
more effectiveness of their measures should help to improve policy harmonisation, closer links to instruments and coordination with private investors should help to improve policy harmonisation, and closer links to instruments and coordination with private investors.
policy consistency in favour of development[26] in the field of food security will be developed through a range of policy tools including agriculture, trade, fisheries, combating climate change, environmental protection and research.
cohesion was strengthened by reforming the common agricultural policy and future reforms, global food security targets will be taken into account.
reform of the Common Fisheries Policy will further increase the coherence of European fisheries policies and fisheries methods on the one hand and development objectives of the other part.
ly, not least, achieving balanced, comprehensive and ambitious results of the Doha Development Programme would strengthen the international trade system, which would have a favourable impact on food security.
to improve the coherence of the EU's international governance system and Member States should better align the way food security is controlled in international scale and to promote the accelerated reform of the Food Reinsurance Committee in the world (CFS) which is the central body in that area.
reformed Committee should aim to pursue supervisory powers in other specific areas affecting food security, e.g. food aid and nutrition in food and nutrition.
priorities for the three UN agencies established in Rome (FAO, WFP, IFAD) should be further vulnerable to synergies, and should also improve their mutual cooperation.
reform of the UN system and ongoing review of the role and priorities of the FAO are an opportunity to increase quality and efficiency.

compliance with the rules of the CRP which are essential for maintaining marine resources should be considered serious if the Member State did not take the necessary measures to remedy the situation leading to the suspension of payment deadlines.
measures referred to in Article 100(2) and Article 101(2) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 must be adopted before interrupting or suspending payments, which further specify the failure to fulfil obligations under the CRP by a Member State which may affect expenditure for which the continuous payment is required.

: If the 10-year limitation period should start running until the transposition of APSA vaccines to the Ministry of Health, it would have to be determined by the exact time of the sale of APMSD to the Ministry of Health, in order to determine the date of the start of the limitation period.
, whether, in that case, the limitation period for APSA would be interrupted in due time by bringing proceedings against APMSD ( 36 ) would, on 16 October 2002, be brought against APSA in any event before the expiry of the 10-year period, if the vaccine would be included in the circulation of the Ministry of Health at the time on 16 October 1992 ( 37 ) .
: 90. Even if it was no longer possible to establish the precise time of the sale of the vaccine to the Ministry of Health, and it would be possible to define it for a period between 22 September 1992 – the date of adoption of the vaccine in APMSD – and on 3 November 1992 – the vaccination of the defendant – would be initiated against APSA on 16 October 2002 in any event, the limitation period of time-limit is interrupted in time.
, if APSA would also have to demonstrate the moment of placing the vaccine into circulation. ( 38 ) .
, if APSA could only define this moment as a certain period beginning over a decade before the application, but it ends less than ten years before it, APSA would have carried out not only the burden of proof but also the probative risk of determining the precise time of initiating the limitation period.
, even if it were not intended to be precisely the time of the circulation, the court proceedings on 16 October 2002 would be initiated in any event in time and consequently, the effects of the suspension of limitation periods should therefore be interrupted.

fight against Dopping Dopping remains a serious threat to sport.
use of doping substances in the event of non-professional athletes constitutes a serious threat to public health and requires preventive measures, including setting up centres for the coating of good physical condition.
prevention and disabilities in the field of doping fall within the competence of sports organisations and Member States.
Commission supports the fight against doping and the important role of the World Anti-Doping Agency, NRAs, NRAs, accredited laboratories, the Council of Europe and UNESCO, the UNESCO UNESCO Organisation.
, the Commission also welcomes the fact that national anti-doping organisations are increasingly organised as independent authorities.
Member States shall choose to adopt and share national anti-doping action plans aimed at ensuring coordination between all relevant sectors.
stakeholders require more active access from the EU to fight against doping, the adoption of the Antidoping Convention of the Council of Europe if it allows the competences in this Union to allow it.

completion of the harmonised framework for mapping Methods In spite of improving the comparability of strategic noise mapping is far from ideal to the situation.
evaluation is apparent from the ongoing assessment that it is still difficult to submit comparable data on the number of people exposed to excessive noise levels.
difficulties are, inter alia, with different data collection, quality and availability of data and the methods used by the evaluation methods used.
is causing different results in EU Member States in the EU Member States.
the comparability level will ultimately lead to the harmonisation of methods(s) to reflect sufficiently sectoral specifications.
in 2008, the Commission started working on the development of harmonised noise exposure assessment methods (as referred to in Article 6(2)).
project entitled ‘CNOSSOS-EU’ (Common method of assessment of noise in Europe), which leads to the Joint Research Centre, shall ensure the technical basis for preparing the Commission Implementing Decision.
: assuming that technical work can be completed in 2011, the Commission considers possible revision of Annex II to the Venture Directive in early 2012 (the following the Committee in 2011 gives a opinion in 2011).
harmonisation and sectoral specifications, such as data requirements, could be met carefully balanced by Harmonised Methodological Framework.
Commission will propose a common work programme of the Commission/European Environment Agency/Member States to implement CNOSSOS-EU project 2012-2015 in order to be operational for the third cycle of reporting in 2017.
developments in the EU Guidelines The number of aspects of the Directive were not detailed or left room for different interpretations and implementation.
Member States have proposed that these issues be addressed through a special action that will help implement and comply with EU level, such as the development of documents with guidance, exchange of best practices or organising special workshops and training courses.
action could focus on these issues: mapping methods and best mapping procedures, noise maps forecasts, dose and response relationships, calculation of repeated exposure, formation of action plans and permissible or target values.
, the Commission of the European Communities shall bear its own costs and the costs incurred by Anton Pieter Roodhuijzen in the context of this procedure.

: Article 28 The Charter ensures the right to collective bargaining.
that right is exercised ‘in accordance with Union law’ shall be exercised ‘in accordance with Union law’.
: If EU law precludes provisions in collective agreement, the national court must not apply this specific provision in so far as it is necessary to remedy illegality.
, if the Court held that the EU law precludes the application of the principle of ‘matched work’ to the child’s dependent contribution would not be to a specific provision establishing a proportionate reduction of that contribution to employees for partial work (in this case Article 22(4) of the collective agreement in the banking sector) to apply.
contributions to the child dependent in full in full in accordance with Article 22(1) of this Treaty would therefore be the contribution to the maintenance child paid in full in full in accordance with Article 22(1) of that contract.

creation of a legal and fiscal environment that is favourable to businesses In order to benefit from all the opportunities offered by the single market, including freedom of establishment, the rules on which the single market is based, simple, adapted and must match the problems encountered by businesses in the daily activities.
measures proposed in this section are counted, inter alia, by reducing administrative and regulatory burden, with positive impacts on growth and job creation[17].
concrete initiatives will be adopted in this framework to ensure interconnection of company registers and mutual recognition of electronic identification and authentication in the European Union.
questions are also essential. The questions of fiscal are also fiscal.
companies or VAT initiatives should limit administrative burden on businesses and facilitate their cross-border activities.
particular attention is also deserving the defence and security sector, as they stimulate development and growth throughout the economy as a result of their top technologies, innovation and know-how.
: 19 : The Commission will adopt initiatives to improve the coordination of national fiscal policies, in particular the proposal for a directive to establish a common consolidated basis for taxation of companies (SKZS) in 2011.
between 27 existing national taxation systems in the EU there are large differences, creating significant fiscal obstacles to cross-border activities of companies, or even this activity precludes.
fragmentation leads to a significant market disturbance and the cost of putting in line with the rules.
, in particular, the SMEs, which often have the necessary means to overcome these deficiencies, and can dissuade them from developing in the single market.
the introduction of a common consolidated basis of taxation of companies is intended to address the problem of fiscal provisions restricting growth.
companies should only be governed by a single set of rules in fiscal matters and should only act with one fiscal administration throughout the EU (‘single contact point’).
should be consolidated at group level and losses should be deducted from profits irrespective of the border.

: 42 By failing to establish Article 2 of the Comitology decision, which provides for the non-binding criteria for the choice of procedural conditions to be respected, according to the appellant, it was wrong to state that the regulatory procedure could only be used for measures with general scope.
: Arguments of the Commission 43 The Commission considers that the statement of recitals 9 in the preamble to Regulation No 3319/4 is not relevant for the purposes of interpreting Article 1(3) of this Regulation, which imposes a specific duty, where two objective conditions are met, namely the implementation of indirect invoicing and imports of ZAP product.

: 51 That performance is incomplete and erroneous, and therefore leads to distortion of the facts.

’s view, it is sufficient that that that common component is not negligible.
, however, it must be noted that the Court of First Instance stated, first, that the overall impression which creates the mark applied for, dominates the element ‘creationales kennya’ to which the consumer concerned will focus in a wide range of his attention and, secondly, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that the element ‘creationale cannya’ is in relation to the ‘creatione kennya’ element, which, in essence, implies that the element ‘ck’ is negligible in the mark applied for.
, in accordance with the correct analysis, the Court of First Instance excluded any similarity between the marks in conflict 53 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, that despite the correct name of the earlier marks and the identity of the goods covered by the marks of the marks between those marks, there is no likelihood of confusion.
, in the first plea, the third part of the first plea must therefore be declared unfounded.
, first ground of appeal must be rejected in those circumstances, first ground of appeal must be rejected.
, second ground, Arguments of the parties 61 By its second plea, the appellant complains that it infringed Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 when it did not examine the good name of the earlier marks within that provision.
, in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance infringed the Court of First Instance, in paragraph 15 of the judgment under appeal, that the appellant claims that the applicant’s only plea, alleging infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation No 40/94, whereas the action was also explicitly based on infringement of Article 8(5) of that Regulation.
: 63 The Court of First Instance erred in law in finding that, since the marks in question are not similar, it is not necessary to examine the good name of the earlier marks.
fact that the earlier mark of CK is a general known CK of Calvin Klein should be taken into account in the appellant for the purpose of determining whether it is to be granted more extensive protection.
name of the earlier mark must be assessed when assessing the similarity between the marks in the conflicting marks and not after similarity has been demonstrated.
: 64 In that regard, the appellant claims that if the prosperous mark was protected only if the third party were ‘cK’ would use the same way graphic shape, it would mean that the mark of the CK with a good name would be granted a level of protection which is practically lower than the level of protection which would enjoy if it were not generally known.
that the mark of cK and other distinct graphic shape of these letters are famous are conferred on them against the use of the letter ‘CK’ in the fashion sector, since they identify Calvin Klein in this sector, so that their use by third party is confused by means of association.
: 65 OHIM claims that, in the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance held the right to question the good names of the earlier mark, the earlier mark, in the judgment under appeal, that the Court held that the earlier mark was right to be a good name of the earlier mark.
that the sign at issue cannot be considered similar, Article 8(5) of Regulation No 40/94 does not apply.
: 66 The company Zafra Marroquineros states that, in the judgment under appeal, the reference to the good name of the earlier marks is made to the earlier marks.

rules for implementing this system should be laid down.
checks may be completed before receiving payments and annual premiums referred to in Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 or after receiving them.
, in particular, where such checks cannot be completed before receiving such payments and annual premiums, the amount to be paid by the beneficiary as a result of administrative penalties should be recovered in accordance with this Regulation or by the start.
rules should be laid down in the Member States responsible for the system of control of cross-compliance obligations in the Member States.
minimum control rate should be laid down for the verification of cross-compliance obligations.
controls should be fixed at least 1 % of the total number of beneficiaries under Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 which fall within the scope of the competent control authorities and which must be selected on the basis of an appropriate risk analysis.
, in the special case of a group of persons under Articles 28 and 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, flexibility should be provided to Member States in determining whether the group will assess as a whole or each member of the group individually.
Member States should be able to choose whether to meet the minimum level of control at the level of each competent control authority, at the level of the paying agency or at the level of the act or standards, or a set of acts or standards.
: If special legislation applicable to the measure or standards provide minimum levels of control, Member States should respect these rates.
Member States should, however, be allowed to use a uniform level of on-the-spot checks on conditionality checks should be applied to Member States.
: If Member States choose this option, all cases of non-compliance identified during the on-the-spot checks referred to in sectoral legislation should be reported and then monitored under conditionality.
in order to simplify the obligation on conditionality in relation to Council Directive 96/22/EC ( 10 ) , the application of the specific level of sampling of the monitoring plans should be considered to be the minimum level of the minimum set out in this Regulation.
Member States should be provided with flexibility necessary to achieve a minimum level of control by using results from other on-the-spot checks or replacement of beneficiaries.
to avoid the weakening of the control system, in particular with regard to the selection of samples for on-the-spot checks, should not be taken into account in the calculation of the minimum control sample concerning conditionality, in relation to the de minimis rule as referred to in Article 97(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013.
findings of significant degree of non-compliance with respect to conditionality should lead to an increase in the number of on-the-spot checks to achieve an acceptable level of security as regards the regularity of the requests for aid in question.
